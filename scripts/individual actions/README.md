###Preparation steps
1. download google chrome and put the dmg in this directory
    * name it `_02_0_googlechrome.dmg`
2. copy the contents of this directory to a thumb drive to run on each individual target machine as you set it up

###Initial steps to run on each computer
1. manually do initial computer setup
	* the computers we used were New In Box, so we had to run through setting up the username, password, date/time, and wireless settings
2. run `_01_0_setHostnames.command` (double-click) to set the hostname as appropriate
3. install Google Chrome from `_02_0_googlechrome.dmg`
4. run `_03_0_bootstrap.command` to do all bootstrapping etc.
